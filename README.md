### Superflows RunPod setup

This repo is for using the Superflows fine-tuned LLM on https://runpod.io.

You want to download the model weights from hugging face and put all `model-0000X-of-0000Y.safetensors` files in the `/zephyr` directory.

The `adapter_model.safetensors` file should live in the `/superflows` directory.

These files aren't included in this repo because they are too large.
